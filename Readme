# Network Security Assessment using Nmap

## Objective

To identify exposed services and analyze security risks on a local machine.

## Tools Used

* Nmap
* Zenmap

## Scan Performed

Intense scan (-T4 -A -v)

## Key Findings

Open ports discovered:

* 135 (MSRPC)
* 139 (NetBIOS)
* 445 (SMB)
* 3306 (MySQL)
* 5357 (WS-Discovery)

## Security Risks

* Lateral movement via SMB
* Data exposure via MySQL
* Internal reconnaissance via NetBIOS

## Conclusion

The system exposes multiple services that increase attack surface and should be restricted using firewall rules and service hardening.
